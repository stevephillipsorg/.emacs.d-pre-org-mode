# .emacs.d
This git repo contains the configuration files I use for Emacs. Its meant to provide the same emacs experience across platforms, which for me is Linux and Mac. It assumes Emacs version 24 or higher.

To use, do the following:

$ cd $HOME
$ mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.sav
$ git clone https://github.com/stevephillipsorg/.emacs.d.git

This will create a new .emacs.d directory under git control that contains this repo.
